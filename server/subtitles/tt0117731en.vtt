1
00:03:34.988 --> 00:03:36.948
Locutus.

2
00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:46.100
I am Locutus of Borg.
Resistance is futile.

3
00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.643
Authorization, Picard 4-7-alpha-tango.

4
00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.063
- Admiral.
- Catch you at a bad time, Jean-Luc?

5
00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.272
No, of course not.

6
00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:36.984
I've just received a disturbing report
from Deep Space Five.

7
00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.279
Our colony on Ivor Prime
was destroyed this morning.

8
00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:44.450
- Long-range sensors have picked up...
- Yes, I know. The Borg.

9
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.291
Captain's Log, Stardate 50893.5.

10
00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:56.379
The moment I have dreaded
for nearly six years has finally arrived.

11
00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:02.259
The Borg, our most lethal enemy, have
begun an invasion of the Federation,

12
00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:06.347
and this time,
there may be no stopping them.

13
00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:08.432
- How many ships?
- One.

14
00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.434
And it's on a direct course for Earth.

15
00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.979
They will cross the Federation border
in less than an hour.

16
00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:16.232
Admiral Hayes is mobilizing a fleet
in the Typhon sector.

17
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.943
At maximum warp,
it will take us three hours, 25 minutes...

18
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.988
- We're not going.
- What do you mean, we're not going?

19
00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.907
Our orders are
to patrol the Neutral Zone

20
00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:27.994
in case the Romulans decide
to take advantage of the situation.

21
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.203
The Romulans?

22
00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.372
Captain, there has been
no unusual activity

23
00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.083
along the Romulan border
for the last nine months.

24
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:37.294
It seems highly unlikely they would
choose this moment to start a conflict.

25
00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.839
Does Starfleet feel
we need more shakedown time?

26
00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:43.634
Captain, we've been out in space
nearly a year now. We're ready.

27
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.387
The Enterprise-E is
the most advanced starship in the fleet.

28
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.805
We should be on the frontline.

29
00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.435
I have gone over all this with
Starfleet Command. Their orders stand.

30
00:05:57.274 --> 00:06:00.735
Number One, set a course
for the Neutral Zone.

31
00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:38.064
- Bizet?
- Berlioz. What do you have?

32
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:42.651
We finished our first sensor sweep
of the Neutral Zone.

33
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.320
Fascinating.

34
00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.323
Twenty particles of space dust
per cubic meter,

35
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:52.036
fifty-two ultraviolet radiation spikes
and a class-2 comet.

36
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.914
This is certainly worthy of our attention.

37
00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:59.710
Captain, why are we out here
chasing comets?

38
00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.922
Let's just say that Starfleet
has every confidence

39
00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:07.468
in the Enterprise and her crew.
They're just not sure about her captain.

40
00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:12.264
They believe that a man who was once
captured and assimilated by the Borg

41
00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.352
should not be put in a situation
where he would face them again.

42
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:21.607
To do so
would introduce an unstable element

43
00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:23.359
to a critical situation.

44
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:26.445
That's ridiculous.
Your experience with the Borg

45
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.031
makes you the perfect man
to lead this fight.

46
00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:30.533
Admiral Hayes disagrees.

47
00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.869
- Bridge to Captain Picard.
- Go ahead.

48
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:38.124
We've just received word from the fleet.
They've engaged the Borg.

49
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:45.506
Mr. Data, put Starfleet frequency 1-4-8-6
on audio.

50
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.924
Aye, sir.

51
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.513
Flagship to Endeavor,
stand by to engage at grid A-15.

52
00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:55.307
Defiant and Bozeman,
fall back to mobile position one.

53
00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.143
Acknowledged.

54
00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:02.523
We have it in visual range. A Borg cube
on course 0 mark 2-1-5, speed warp...

55
00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:08.154
We are the Borg. Lower your shields
and surrender your ships.

56
00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:11.949
We will add your biological
and technological distinctiveness

57
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:16.203
to our own.
Your culture will adapt to service us.

58
00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.330
Resistance is futile.

59
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.376
All units, open fire. Remodulate shield...

60
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.253
They've broken through
the defense perimeter...

61
00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.713
...toward Earth. Pursuit course...

62
00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.841
The cube is changing course.
0-2-1 mark 4.

63
00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.843
Defiant, continue to attack.

64
00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.596
Flagship to Starfleet Command.
We need reinforcements.

65
00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.765
Casualty report is coming in...

66
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.727
...96 dead, 22 wounded
on the Lexington.

67
00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:45.608
Lieutenant Hawk, set a course for Earth.

68
00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.943
- Aye, sir.
- Maximum warp.

69
00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.908
I'm about to commit
a direct violation of our orders.

70
00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.285
Any of you who wish to object
should do so now.

71
00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.537
It will be noted in my log.

72
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:06.837
Captain, I believe I speak
for everyone here, sir, when I say

73
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.717
to hell with our orders.

74
00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.724
Red alert! All hands to battle stations!

75
00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.018
Engage.

76
00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.640
- Report!
- Main power is off-line.

77
00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:01.976
We've lost shields and
our weapons are gone.

78
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:10.526
Perhaps today is a good day to die.
Prepare for ramming speed!

79
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.904
Sir, there's another starship coming in.

80
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.907
It's the Enterprise.

81
00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.460
The Defiant's losing life support.

82
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:32.089
Bridge to Transporter Room 3.
Beam the Defiant survivors aboard.

83
00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.217
Captain, the Admiral's ship
has been destroyed.

84
00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.720
What is the status of the Borg cube?

85
00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.347
It has sustained heavy damage
to its outer hull.

86
00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:43.267
I am reading fluctuations
in their power grid.

87
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:44.518
Onscreen.

88
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.362
Number One,
open a channel to the fleet.

89
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.865
Channel open, sir.

90
00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:01.410
This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise.
I'm taking command of the fleet.

91
00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:05.080
Target all of your weapons
onto the following coordinates.

92
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.249
- Fire on my command.
- Sir.

93
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.085
The coordinates you have indicated
do not appear to be a vital system.

94
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.754
Trust me, Data.

95
00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:15.674
The fleet's responded, sir.
They're standing by.

96
00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.097
Fire.

97
00:11:57.384 --> 00:12:00.844
- Mr. Hawk, pursuit course. Engage.
- Aye, sir.

98
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.310
What?

99
00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.813
I can hear them.

100
00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:16.151
I have a patient here
who insists on coming to the Bridge.

101
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.154
Welcome aboard
the Enterprise-E, Mr. Worf.

102
00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.906
Thank you, sir.

103
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.536
- The Defiant?
- Adrift but salvageable.

104
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.704
- Tough little ship.
- Little?

105
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.209
Mr. Worf, we could use some help
at tactical.

106
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.674
You do remember how to fire phasers?

107
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.436
Sensors show chronometric particles
emanating from the sphere.

108
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.730
- They're creating a temporal vortex.
- Time travel.

109
00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.284
Data, report.

110
00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:07.953
We appear to be caught
in a temporal wake.

111
00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:10.038
Captain. Earth.

112
00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.837
The atmosphere contains
high concentrations of methane,

113
00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.839
carbon monoxide and fluorine.

114
00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:22.718
- Life-signs?
- Population, approximately 9 billion.

115
00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.304
All Borg.

116
00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:29.266
- How?
- They must've done it in the past.

117
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.436
They went back and assimilated Earth,
changed history.

118
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.481
But if they changed history,
why are we still here?

119
00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:37.483
The temporal wake
must have somehow protected us

120
00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.902
from the changes in the timeline.

121
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:46.033
- Sir, the vortex is collapsing.
- Hold your course, Mr. Hawk.

122
00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:49.995
We must follow them back,
repair whatever damage they've done.

123
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:23.403
- Come on.
- Good night, Eddie.

124
00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.490
Go home.

125
00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.744
You're gonna regret this tomorrow.

126
00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:34.540
One of the things you should
have learned about me by now

127
00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.875
is that I don't have regrets.

128
00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:41.213
- Come on, Lily. One more round.
- Z. Z, you had enough.

129
00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:44.174
I'm not going up in that thing
with a drunken pilot.

130
00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:47.302
I sure as hell
am not going up there sober.

131
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.389
What is that?

132
00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:54.977
That is the constellation Leo.

133
00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.104
No. That.

134
00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:09.157
- It's an ECON!
- After all these years?

135
00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.250
We gotta get to the Phoenix.

136
00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.007
To hell with the Phoenix.

137
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:30.637
- Help! Help!
- Hurry! Move out! Move!

138
00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.764
This way! Zefram!

139
00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:47.696
Report.

140
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:51.491
Shields are down, long-range sensors
are off-line, main power's holding.

141
00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:55.579
According to our astrometric readings,
we are in the mid-21st century.

142
00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:58.081
From the radioactive isotopes
in the atmosphere, I would estimate

143
00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:02.085
we have arrived approximately
10 years after the Third World War.

144
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.796
Makes sense. Most of the major cities
have been destroyed,

145
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.716
very few governments left,
600 million dead.

146
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:10.302
- No resistance.
- Captain.

147
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.766
Mr. Worf, quantum torpedoes.

148
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.768
- Ready, sir.
- Fire.

149
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.575
They were firing at the surface.
Location?

150
00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:37.704
Western hemisphere,
North American continent.

151
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.416
Looks like a missile complex
in central Montana.

152
00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.627
Missile complex.

153
00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:47.964
The date.
Data, I need to know the exact date.

154
00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:51.760
April 4th, 2063.

155
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:56.431
- April 4th, the day before first contact.
- Precisely.

156
00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:57.849
Then the missile complex must be

157
00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.560
where Zefram Cochrane is building
his warp ship.

158
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.855
That's what they came here to do,
stop first contact.

159
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.565
How much damage, Lieutenant?

160
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.318
Can't tell.
Long-range sensors are still off-line.

161
00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.112
We have to go down there,
find out what happened.

162
00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.863
Data, Beverly, you're with me.

163
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.866
Have a security team meet us
in Transporter Room 3.

164
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:17.869
Computer, mid-21st century
civilian clothing.

165
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.956
Number One, you have the Bridge.

166
00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:32.384
Over here.

167
00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:58.410
They're all dead.

168
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:08.837
See if one of them is Cochrane.
Data, let's go check the warp ship.

169
00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:33.111
The structural integrity of the missile
appears to be intact,

170
00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:36.573
but there is significant damage
to various sections of the fuselage

171
00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:38.992
and primary intercooler system.

172
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.870
We should have the original blueprints
in the Enterprise computer.

173
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.539
Commander La Forge will need
to bring a team down here...

174
00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:49.044
- Hold your fire! We're here to help you!
- Bullshit!

175
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.217
Captain, I believe I can handle this.

176
00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.242
Greetings.

177
00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:32.128
Captain, this woman requires
medical attention.

178
00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:39.845
Severe theta radiation poisoning.

179
00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.681
Radiation is coming
from the damaged throttle assembly.

180
00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:44.766
We're all gonna have to be inoculated,

181
00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:47.352
- and I have to get her to Sickbay.
- Doctor...

182
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.062
Please, no lectures
about the Prime Directive.

183
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.814
I will keep her unconscious.

184
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:54.067
Very well. Tell Commander Riker
to beam down with a search party.

185
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:55.569
We need to find Cochrane.

186
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:59.739
Crusher to Enterprise,
two to beam directly to Sickbay.

187
00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.873
We have less than 14 hours
before this ship has to be launched.

188
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.417
- Picard to Engineering.
- La Forge here.

189
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:12.711
Geordi, Cochrane's ship was damaged
in the attack.

190
00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:15.130
Get down here with an engineering
detail. We have work to do.

191
00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:18.008
Right. I'm on my way, Captain.

192
00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:20.510
Alpha team, let's assemble
in Transporter Room 3.

193
00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:21.970
We're heading down to the surface.

194
00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.306
Porter, you're gonna be in command
till I get back.

195
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.224
- Aye, sir.
- And, Porter,

196
00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.435
check out the environmental controls
while I'm gone.

197
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:31.563
It's getting a little warm in here.
All right, let's go.

198
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.951
Looks like a good spot right here.

199
00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:51.666
Isnï¿½t it amazing?

200
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:56.338
This ship used to be a nuclear missile.

201
00:20:58.007 --> 00:20:59.382
It is an historical irony

202
00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:02.135
that Dr. Cochrane would choose
an instrument of mass destruction

203
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:04.512
to inaugurate an era of peace.

204
00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:18.526
It's a boyhood fantasy, Data.

205
00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:22.238
I must've seen this ship
hundreds of times in the Smithsonian,

206
00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.658
but I was never able to touch it.

207
00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:29.537
Sir, does tactile contact alter
your perception of the Phoenix?

208
00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.206
Oh, yes.

209
00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:35.961
For humans, touch can connect you
to an object in a very personal way,

210
00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:37.921
make it seem more real.

211
00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:48.598
I am detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing,

212
00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:52.936
temperature variations
in the fuel manifold.

213
00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:57.524
It is no more real to me now
than it was a moment ago.

214
00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.652
Would you three like to be alone?

215
00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:03.363
What have you found out?

216
00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:06.241
There's no sign of Cochrane
anywhere in the complex.

217
00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:07.701
He has to be here.

218
00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:10.412
There was nothing more important
to him than this ship.

219
00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:12.455
This flight, it was his dream.

220
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.666
Captain, we should consider
the possibility

221
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.544
that Dr. Cochrane was killed
in the attack.

222
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:24.092
If that's true,
then the future may die with him.

223
00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:33.768
What do you think?

224
00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:36.521
It's like the entire
environmental system's gone crazy.

225
00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:39.315
It's not just Engineering.
It's the entire deck.

226
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.235
Maybe it's a problem
with the EPS conduits.

227
00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:51.453
Hello?

228
00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:54.581
- Hey!
- Are you talking to me?

229
00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:59.502
Is there anyone else
working maintenance in this section?

230
00:22:59.587 --> 00:23:01.337
Not that I know of.

231
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:13.892
Paul?

232
00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:22.317
Paul? Are you okay in there?

233
00:23:39.168 --> 00:23:41.086
Captain? What is it?

234
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:46.341
Picard to Enterprise.

235
00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:48.343
Mr. Worf, is everything all right
up there?

236
00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:52.430
Yes, sir. We are experiencing some
environmental difficulties on Deck 16,

237
00:23:52.515 --> 00:23:53.598
but that is all.

238
00:23:53.682 --> 00:23:57.185
- What kind of difficulties?
- Humidity levels have risen 73%

239
00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:00.355
and the temperature has jumped
10 degrees in the last hour.

240
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.566
- Mr. Data and I are returning to the ship.
- Understood.

241
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:06.528
- Number One, take charge down here.
- Aye, sir.

242
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.948
Damage to her cell membranes
is repaired.

243
00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:10.990
She should be fine,

244
00:24:11.075 --> 00:24:13.701
but I'd like to run another test
on her spinal tissue.

245
00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:16.454
And find out why it's so hot in here.

246
00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:18.373
Now what?

247
00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:20.542
Crusher to Engineering.

248
00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:23.795
Crusher to Bridge.

249
00:24:25.256 --> 00:24:28.424
Commander Worf, I need to know
exactly what's been happening.

250
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:30.426
We just lost contact with Deck 16.

251
00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:32.846
Communications, internal sensors,
everything.

252
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.098
I was about to send a security team
to investigate.

253
00:24:35.182 --> 00:24:36.975
No! Seal off Deck 16.

254
00:24:37.059 --> 00:24:38.768
Post security teams
at every access point.

255
00:24:38.853 --> 00:24:40.311
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Hawk.

256
00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:41.521
Before we lost internal sensors,

257
00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:44.274
what were the exact environmental
conditions in Main Engineering?

258
00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:46.651
Atmospheric pressure
was two kilopascals above normal,

259
00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:49.571
ninety-two percent humidity,
39.1 degrees Celsius.

260
00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:51.739
Thirty-nine-point-one degrees Celsius.

261
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.409
Like a Borg ship.

262
00:24:55.786 --> 00:24:59.038
They knew their ship was doomed.
Our shields were down.

263
00:24:59.123 --> 00:25:02.625
Somehow they transported over here
without being detected.

264
00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:07.755
They'll assimilate the Enterprise,
and then Earth.

265
00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:11.843
Picard to Riker.

266
00:25:14.889 --> 00:25:16.890
Enterprise to away team.

267
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:20.935
Respond!

268
00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:25.440
Sir, main control is being rerouted
through Main Engineering.

269
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.109
Weapons, shields, propulsion.

270
00:25:28.194 --> 00:25:31.196
Quickly, Mr. Data!
Lock out the main computer!

271
00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:42.290
I have isolated the main computer
with a fractal encryption code.

272
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:45.919
It is highly unlikely
the Borg will be able to break it.

273
00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:49.714
The Borg have cut primary power
to all decks except 16.

274
00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:52.133
The Borg won't stay on Deck 16.

275
00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:58.264
Wake up. You're all right.
Come on. Come on. Wake up.

276
00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:01.726
Take it easy. Stay calm.
You are all right!

277
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.061
- Now, listen to me. Look at me.
- No!

278
00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:05.146
You are gonna be fine.
I need you to do as I say.

279
00:26:05.231 --> 00:26:08.775
Alyssa, is the EMH program still online?

280
00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:11.361
- It should be.
- That's it. That's a girl.

281
00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:14.822
I swore I'd never use one of these.
Computer, activate the EMH program.

282
00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:18.618
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

283
00:26:18.702 --> 00:26:20.495
Twenty Borg are about
to break through that door.

284
00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:23.414
We need time to get out of here.
Create a diversion!

285
00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:27.210
This isn't part of my program.
I'm a doctor, not a doorstop.

286
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.381
Well, do a dance, tell a story.
I don't care. Just give us a few seconds.

287
00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:40.473
According to Starfleet medical research,

288
00:26:40.891 --> 00:26:44.394
Borg implants can cause
severe skin irritations.

289
00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:47.814
Perhaps you'd like an analgesic cream?

290
00:26:54.113 --> 00:26:55.446
Which way?

291
00:26:56.198 --> 00:26:58.950
We need to get off this deck.
Follow me.

292
00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:16.426
First thing they'll do in Engineering
is establish a collective,

293
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.095
a central point
from which they can control the hive.

294
00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:22.432
The problem is, if we begin firing
particle weapons in Engineering,

295
00:27:22.516 --> 00:27:25.435
there's a risk
that we may hit the warp core.

296
00:27:27.521 --> 00:27:31.774
I believe our goal should be to puncture
one of the plasma coolant tanks.

297
00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:33.568
- Data?
- Excellent idea.

298
00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:36.821
Plasma coolant will liquefy
organic material on contact.

299
00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:39.157
But the Borg are not entirely organic.

300
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:41.409
True, but like all cybernetic life-forms,

301
00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:44.620
they cannot survive
without their organic components.

302
00:27:44.705 --> 00:27:48.207
I have ordered all weapons to be set
on a rotating modulation.

303
00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:53.129
The Borg will adapt quickly.
We will be able to fire 12 shots at most.

304
00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:54.797
One other thing.

305
00:27:57.259 --> 00:27:58.843
You may encounter
Enterprise crew members

306
00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:02.472
who've already been assimilated.
Don't hesitate to fire.

307
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:05.933
Believe me,
you'll be doing them a favor.

308
00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:08.603
Let's go.

309
00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:44.972
Deanna! Deanna!

310
00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:48.935
No, no! Don't turn off the...

311
00:28:51.105 --> 00:28:52.772
Who is this jerk?

312
00:28:55.943 --> 00:28:58.277
Who told him
he could turn off my music?

313
00:28:58.362 --> 00:29:02.031
Will Riker, Zefram Cochrane.

314
00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:08.162
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Yes.

315
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:10.248
- Husband?
- No.

316
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:12.458
Good.

317
00:29:14.837 --> 00:29:17.171
- Now, this, Deena...
- Deanna.

318
00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:24.137
- This is the good stuff.
- Dr. Cochrane...

319
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.017
To the Phoenix, may she rest in peace.

320
00:29:39.653 --> 00:29:41.863
Okay, that wasn't so good.

321
00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:47.577
Will, I think we have to tell him the truth.

322
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.163
- If we tell the truth, the timeline...
- Timeline?

323
00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:55.084
This is no time to argue about time.
We don't have the time.

324
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.508
- What was I saying?
- You're drunk.

325
00:30:02.593 --> 00:30:04.677
- I am not!
- Yes, you are.

326
00:30:05.387 --> 00:30:09.557
Look, he wouldn't even talk to me
unless I had a drink with him.

327
00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:13.519
And then it took three shots
of something called tequila

328
00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:16.731
just to find out
he was the one we're looking for.

329
00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:21.068
And I've spent the last 20 minutes
trying to keep his hands off me.

330
00:30:21.195 --> 00:30:24.697
So don't go criticizing
my counseling technique.

331
00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:25.948
Sorry.

332
00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:30.620
It's a primitive culture.

333
00:30:32.915 --> 00:30:36.292
- I'm just trying to blend in.
- You're blended, all right.

334
00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:40.004
I already told him our cover story.
He didn't believe me.

335
00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:41.380
We are running out of time.

336
00:30:41.465 --> 00:30:45.343
Now, if we tell him the truth,
do you think he'll be able to handle it?

337
00:30:47.638 --> 00:30:52.767
If you're looking for my professional
opinion as ship's counselor,

338
00:30:53.393 --> 00:30:56.771
- he's nuts.
- I'll be sure to note that in my log.

339
00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:29.780
Captain, I believe I am feeling anxiety.

340
00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:34.285
It is an intriguing sensation.
A most distracting...

341
00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:36.579
Data, I'm sure
it's a fascinating experience,

342
00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:40.583
but perhaps you should deactivate
your emotion chip for now.

343
00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:42.293
Good idea, sir.

344
00:32:43.837 --> 00:32:44.920
Done.

345
00:32:45.922 --> 00:32:48.549
Data, there are times that I envy you.

346
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:03.022
It's only me!

347
00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:06.817
- Doctor, are you all right?
- Yes, but we have wounded here.

348
00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:10.237
Lopez, get these people
back to Deck 14.

349
00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:12.990
There was a civilian,
a woman from the 21st century.

350
00:33:13.075 --> 00:33:14.992
- We got separated.
- We will watch for her.

351
00:33:15.077 --> 00:33:18.579
Worf, she has no idea what's going on.
Try to find her.

352
00:33:40.686 --> 00:33:42.269
Lower your weapons.

353
00:33:43.063 --> 00:33:46.232
They'll ignore us
till they consider us a threat.

354
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.819
The manual release.

355
00:34:33.822 --> 00:34:36.157
Mr. Worf, hold this position.

356
00:34:42.706 --> 00:34:44.707
Manual release is online.

357
00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:54.258
Perhaps we should just knock.

358
00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.180
Data.

359
00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:12.610
Ready phasers!

360
00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:28.459
Data, cover me.

361
00:35:37.511 --> 00:35:39.011
Captain, they've adapted!

362
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:20.386
Regroup on Deck 15.
Don't let them touch you!

363
00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:26.559
- Captain!
- Data!

364
00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.663
Here!

365
00:36:50.584 --> 00:36:51.876
Captain!

366
00:36:52.961 --> 00:36:54.128
Help.

367
00:36:56.423 --> 00:36:58.757
Please, help.

368
00:37:18.653 --> 00:37:20.738
- You! How the hell did you...
- Back off!

369
00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:22.573
- Calm down!
- Shut up!

370
00:37:24.034 --> 00:37:25.659
- Who are you?
- My name is Jean-Luc Picard...

371
00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:28.370
No! Who are you with? What faction?

372
00:37:28.455 --> 00:37:30.873
I'm not a member
of the Eastern Coalition. Listen...

373
00:37:30.957 --> 00:37:32.124
I said shut up!

374
00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:34.418
I don't care who you're with.
Get me the hell out of here.

375
00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:35.502
Now!

376
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.005
That isn't going to be easy.

377
00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:39.882
Well, you better find a way
to make it easy, soldier,

378
00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:41.216
or I'm gonna start pushing buttons.

379
00:37:41.301 --> 00:37:42.635
All right!

380
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:48.349
- Follow me.
- Slow!

381
00:38:32.894 --> 00:38:34.561
Your efforts to break
the encryption codes

382
00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:36.355
will not be successful.

383
00:38:36.773 --> 00:38:40.150
Nor will your attempts to assimilate me
into your collective.

384
00:38:40.235 --> 00:38:41.610
Brave words.

385
00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:45.656
I've heard them before,
from thousands of species

386
00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.868
across thousands of worlds
since long before you were created.

387
00:38:49.953 --> 00:38:52.621
But now, they are all Borg.

388
00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:56.542
I am unlike any life-form
you have encountered before.

389
00:38:57.127 --> 00:39:00.963
The codes stored in my neural net
cannot be forcibly removed.

390
00:39:01.047 --> 00:39:04.591
You are an imperfect being
created by an imperfect being.

391
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:08.762
Finding your weakness
is only a matter of time.

392
00:39:18.314 --> 00:39:21.025
Let me just make sure
that I understand you correctly,

393
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:22.609
Commander.

394
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:26.989
A group of cybernetic creatures
from the future

395
00:39:27.741 --> 00:39:31.285
have traveled back through time
to enslave the human race,

396
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.580
- and you're here to stop them?
- That's right.

397
00:39:34.664 --> 00:39:37.249
Hot damn. You're heroic.

398
00:39:39.669 --> 00:39:42.254
We're gonna prove it to you. Geordi!

399
00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:45.883
- There she is. Beautiful!
- Here we go.

400
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.554
- All right, take a look.
- Well, well, well.

401
00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:53.307
What do we got here?

402
00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:56.185
I love a good peep show.

403
00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:09.656
That's a trick.

404
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.829
- How'd you do that?
- It's your telescope.

405
00:40:16.498 --> 00:40:18.832
That's our ship, the Enterprise.

406
00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:30.385
- And Lily's up there right now?
- That's right.

407
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:31.428
Can I talk to her?

408
00:40:31.513 --> 00:40:35.224
We've lost contact with the Enterprise.
We don't know why yet.

409
00:40:35.892 --> 00:40:38.227
So, what is it you want me to do?

410
00:40:38.311 --> 00:40:42.314
Simple. Conduct your warp flight
tomorrow morning just as you planned.

411
00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:45.025
Why tomorrow morning?

412
00:40:48.822 --> 00:40:53.325
Because at 11:00 an alien ship will
begin passing through this solar system.

413
00:40:53.701 --> 00:40:56.453
Alien. You mean extraterrestrials?

414
00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:00.082
- More bad guys?
- Good guys.

415
00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:03.627
They're on a survey mission.
They have no interest in Earth.

416
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:05.170
Too primitive.

417
00:41:06.673 --> 00:41:10.759
Doctor, tomorrow morning, when they
detect the warp signature from your ship

418
00:41:10.844 --> 00:41:13.262
and realize that humans have
discovered how to travel

419
00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:16.348
faster than light,
they decide to alter their course.

420
00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:19.476
They make first contact with Earth,
right here.

421
00:41:19.561 --> 00:41:22.187
- Here?
- Actually, over there.

422
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.482
It is one of the pivotal moments
in human history, Doctor.

423
00:41:25.567 --> 00:41:27.985
You get to make first contact
with an alien race,

424
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:31.405
and after you do,
everything begins to change.

425
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:35.159
Your theories on warp drive
allow fleets of starships to be built,

426
00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:37.828
and mankind
to start exploring the galaxy.

427
00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.998
It unites humanity in a way
that no one ever thought possible

428
00:41:41.082 --> 00:41:43.625
when they realize
they're not alone in the universe.

429
00:41:44.377 --> 00:41:48.338
Poverty, disease, war, they'll all be gone
within the next 50 years.

430
00:41:48.423 --> 00:41:52.551
But unless you make that warp flight
tomorrow morning before 11:15,

431
00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:54.553
none of it will happen.

432
00:41:55.263 --> 00:42:01.351
And you people, you're all astronauts
on some kind of star trek.

433
00:42:02.103 --> 00:42:04.521
Look, Doc, I know
this is a lot for you to take in,

434
00:42:04.606 --> 00:42:08.108
but we're running out of time here.
We need your help.

435
00:42:10.153 --> 00:42:11.778
What do you say?

436
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:24.958
Why not?

437
00:43:25.687 --> 00:43:27.271
It's pretty bad, sir.

438
00:43:27.355 --> 00:43:30.190
It looks like they control
Decks 26 up to 11.

439
00:43:30.275 --> 00:43:33.277
But when they took Deck 11,
they just stopped.

440
00:43:34.696 --> 00:43:37.864
The Borg have assimilated more than
half the ship in a matter of hours.

441
00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:40.742
Why stop there? What is on Deck 11?

442
00:43:40.827 --> 00:43:43.537
Hydroponics, stellar cartography,
deflector control.

443
00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:45.747
- No vital system.
- They would not have stopped there

444
00:43:45.832 --> 00:43:48.542
unless it gave them
a tactical advantage.

445
00:43:49.294 --> 00:43:50.377
Return to your checkpoint.

446
00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:51.878
- Send reports every 10 minutes.
- Right, sir.

447
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.881
Something must've happened
in Sickbay.

448
00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:56.300
Where are Dr. Crusher and the others?

449
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:57.926
Why did you break the cease-fire?

450
00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:00.220
- We didn't attack you!
- Who did?

451
00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:07.728
There's a new faction

452
00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:09.813
that wants to prevent your launch
tomorrow morning,

453
00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:11.898
but we are here to help you.

454
00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:15.986
This may be difficult for you to accept,
but you are not in Montana anymore.

455
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:21.366
You're on a ship, a spaceship
orbiting the Earth at an altitude of...

456
00:44:21.451 --> 00:44:24.244
You wanna help me, get me out of here.

457
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.038
All right.

458
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:30.459
You want a way out. Here it is.

459
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:34.796
What is this?

460
00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:43.096
Australia, New Guinea, the Solomons.

461
00:44:44.015 --> 00:44:47.017
Montana will be up soon,
but you may want to hold your breath.

462
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:48.935
It's a long way down.

463
00:44:49.812 --> 00:44:54.441
Now, listen to me. I'm not your enemy,
and I can get you home,

464
00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:57.944
but first you must put that weapon down
and trust me.

465
00:45:03.493 --> 00:45:05.285
Jean-Luc Picard.

466
00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:09.456
My name. That's my name.
What's yours?

467
00:45:12.627 --> 00:45:13.752
Lily.

468
00:45:14.462 --> 00:45:16.296
Welcome aboard, Lily.

469
00:45:23.304 --> 00:45:24.638
Thank you.

470
00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:31.728
Maximum setting. If you'd fired this,
you would've vaporized me.

471
00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:35.774
It's my first ray gun.

472
00:45:53.543 --> 00:45:55.168
There's no glass.

473
00:45:58.923 --> 00:46:00.382
Force field.

474
00:46:00.842 --> 00:46:03.093
I've never seen that kind of technology.

475
00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:05.720
That's because
it hasn't been invented yet.

476
00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:07.013
What?

477
00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:12.352
There's more I have to tell you.
Come on.

478
00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:19.776
Are you ready?

479
00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:24.030
- Who are you?
- I am the Borg.

480
00:46:24.532 --> 00:46:29.202
That is a contradiction. The Borg
have a collective consciousness.

481
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:31.329
There are no individuals.

482
00:46:38.379 --> 00:46:44.009
I am the beginning, the end,
the one who is many.

483
00:46:58.733 --> 00:47:00.233
I am the Borg.

484
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:04.404
Greetings.

485
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:09.409
I am curious.
Do you control the Borg collective?

486
00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:14.372
You imply a disparity where none exists.
I am the collective.

487
00:47:14.874 --> 00:47:17.125
Perhaps I should rephrase the question.

488
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.462
I wish to understand
the organizational relationships.

489
00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:22.339
Are you their leader?

490
00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:26.551
I bring order to chaos.

491
00:47:28.471 --> 00:47:31.014
An interesting if cryptic response.

492
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:33.808
You are in chaos, Data.

493
00:47:35.061 --> 00:47:38.855
You are the contradiction.
A machine who wishes to be human.

494
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.732
Since you seem to know
so much about me,

495
00:47:41.067 --> 00:47:45.278
you must be aware that I am
programmed to evolve, to better myself.

496
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:48.740
We, too, are on a quest
to better ourselves,

497
00:47:49.492 --> 00:47:52.077
evolving toward a state of perfection.

498
00:47:52.453 --> 00:47:57.040
Forgive me, but the Borg do not evolve.
They conquer.

499
00:47:58.334 --> 00:48:02.254
By assimilating other beings
into our collective,

500
00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:05.632
we are bringing them closer
to perfection.

501
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.636
Somehow, I question your motives.

502
00:48:10.513 --> 00:48:12.681
That is because
you haven't been properly

503
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:15.976
stimulated yet.

504
00:48:22.149 --> 00:48:26.027
You have reactivated my emotion chip.

505
00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:30.198
- Why?
- Don't be frightened.

506
00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:34.035
I am not frightened.

507
00:48:40.209 --> 00:48:42.085
Do you know what this is, Data?

508
00:48:42.712 --> 00:48:45.171
It would appear you are attempting
to graft organic skin

509
00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:47.340
onto my endoskeletal structure.

510
00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:53.013
What a cold description
for such a beautiful gift.

511
00:49:08.321 --> 00:49:10.196
Was that good for you?

512
00:49:17.997 --> 00:49:19.873
How many planets
are in this Federation?

513
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:23.501
Over 150,
spread across 8,000 light-years.

514
00:49:23.586 --> 00:49:25.253
You must not get home much.

515
00:49:26.047 --> 00:49:28.548
Actually, I tend to think of this ship
as home.

516
00:49:28.633 --> 00:49:32.177
But if it's Earth you're talking about,
I try to get back whenever I can.

517
00:49:33.846 --> 00:49:36.765
Good. They haven't broken
the encryption codes yet.

518
00:49:36.891 --> 00:49:39.351
Who, those bionic zombies
you told me about? The...

519
00:49:39.435 --> 00:49:42.937
- Borg.
- Borg? Sounds Swedish.

520
00:49:48.361 --> 00:49:51.738
- How big is this ship?
- There are 24 decks,

521
00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:56.368
almost 700 meters long.

522
00:49:56.452 --> 00:49:59.663
It took me six months
to scrounge up enough titanium

523
00:49:59.747 --> 00:50:02.248
just to build a four-meter cockpit.

524
00:50:07.129 --> 00:50:09.339
How much did this thing cost?

525
00:50:10.591 --> 00:50:13.927
The economics of the future
are somewhat different.

526
00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:18.807
You see, money doesn't exist
in the 24th century.

527
00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:22.644
No money?
You mean you don't get paid?

528
00:50:23.187 --> 00:50:27.440
The acquisition of wealth is no longer
the driving force in our lives.

529
00:50:28.818 --> 00:50:33.530
We work to better ourselves
and the rest of humanity.

530
00:50:37.618 --> 00:50:40.995
Actually, we're rather like yourself
and Dr. Cochrane.

531
00:50:43.916 --> 00:50:45.709
All right! All right.

532
00:50:47.628 --> 00:50:50.964
- Come on.
- Is there another way around?

533
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.301
I know what I'm doing.

534
00:51:04.437 --> 00:51:06.354
Definitely not Swedish.

535
00:51:38.679 --> 00:51:40.180
What the hell are you doing?

536
00:51:53.652 --> 00:51:55.737
Perhaps something in satin?

537
00:52:04.747 --> 00:52:07.207
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but we're closing.

538
00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:10.168
And you do understand
we have a strict dress code,

539
00:52:10.252 --> 00:52:12.378
so if you boys don't leave right now, I'll...

540
00:52:16.884 --> 00:52:18.885
I'm looking for Nicky the Nose.

541
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.513
The Nose?
He hasn't been here in months.

542
00:52:25.267 --> 00:52:26.518
This is the wrong chapter.

543
00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:32.357
Computer! Begin chapter 13.

544
00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:39.823
Try and look
as if you're having a good time.

545
00:52:54.046 --> 00:52:57.298
No, no, no, look at me!
Try to act naturally.

546
00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:03.930
There he is.

547
00:53:14.441 --> 00:53:17.026
Ruby, this is not a good time.

548
00:53:17.111 --> 00:53:20.405
It's never the time for us, is it, Dix?
Always some excuse,

549
00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:24.409
- some case you're working on.
- I have to talk to Nicky. I'll see you later.

550
00:53:24.493 --> 00:53:26.494
Okay, but watch your caboose.

551
00:53:26.996 --> 00:53:28.621
And dump the broad.

552
00:53:37.298 --> 00:53:40.049
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

553
00:53:40.134 --> 00:53:41.217
What's shaking, Dix?

554
00:53:41.302 --> 00:53:44.345
The usual, Nick. Martinis and skirts.
Excuse me.

555
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:49.893
Hey, I'm going to take that personal
in a second.

556
00:53:49.977 --> 00:53:50.977
No offense.

557
00:53:52.271 --> 00:53:53.354
Hey!

558
00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.590
Hey!

559
00:54:20.674 --> 00:54:22.508
I think you got him.

560
00:54:27.348 --> 00:54:28.640
I don't get it.

561
00:54:28.724 --> 00:54:30.767
I thought you said
this was all just a bunch of holograms.

562
00:54:30.851 --> 00:54:33.686
- If it's holograms...
- I disengaged the safety protocols.

563
00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:37.774
Without them,
even a holographic bullet can kill.

564
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.444
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for the neuroprocessor.

565
00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:45.782
Every Borg has one.
It's like a memory chip.

566
00:54:47.201 --> 00:54:49.619
It will contain a record
of all the instructions

567
00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:51.913
this Borg has been receiving
from the collective.

568
00:54:51.997 --> 00:54:56.376
Oh, my.
Jean-Luc, it's one of your uniforms.

569
00:54:57.378 --> 00:54:59.879
Yes, this was Ensign Lynch.

570
00:55:02.049 --> 00:55:03.716
Tough luck, huh?

571
00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:09.180
I've gotta get to the Bridge.

572
00:55:19.733 --> 00:55:21.067
Good morning, sir.

573
00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:38.918
Doctor?

574
00:55:40.087 --> 00:55:43.089
- Yeah?
- Would you mind taking a look at this?

575
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:45.800
Yeah.

576
00:55:47.594 --> 00:55:49.345
I tried to reconstruct
the intermix chamber

577
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:51.514
from what I remember in school.

578
00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:53.725
Tell me if I got it right.

579
00:55:54.143 --> 00:55:55.685
School?

580
00:55:55.769 --> 00:55:57.895
- You learned about this in school?
- Oh, yeah.

581
00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:01.065
Basic Warp Design is
a required course at the Academy.

582
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:04.819
The first chapter is called
"Zefram Cochrane."

583
00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:10.158
Well, it looks like you got it right.

584
00:56:10.659 --> 00:56:13.619
Commander, this is
what we're thinking of using

585
00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:16.497
to replace the damaged
warp plasma conduit.

586
00:56:24.506 --> 00:56:27.008
Yeah, Reg. Yeah, that's good,

587
00:56:27.092 --> 00:56:30.386
but you need to reinforce
this copper tubing with a nanopolymer.

588
00:56:31.055 --> 00:56:35.099
Dr. Cochrane, I know this sounds silly,
but can I shake your hand?

589
00:56:38.812 --> 00:56:39.896
Thank you, Doctor.

590
00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.523
I can't tell you what an honor it is
to work with you on this project.

591
00:56:42.608 --> 00:56:44.025
- Reg.
- I never imagined that I'd be meeting

592
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:46.194
- the man who invented warp drive. I...
- Reg!

593
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:49.822
I'm sorry. Right. Thanks.

594
00:56:58.248 --> 00:57:00.666
Do they have to keep doing that?

595
00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:04.212
It's just a little hero worship, Doc.

596
00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:07.131
To tell you the truth,
I can't say I blame them.

597
00:57:07.216 --> 00:57:09.509
We all grew up
hearing about what you did here.

598
00:57:09.593 --> 00:57:12.011
Or what you're about to do.

599
00:57:12.346 --> 00:57:15.098
You know,
I probably shouldn't even tell you this,

600
00:57:15.182 --> 00:57:18.101
but I went
to Zefram Cochrane High School.

601
00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:20.186
Really?

602
00:57:22.981 --> 00:57:25.691
You know, I wish I had a picture of this.

603
00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.363
- What?
- Well, you see,

604
00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:34.826
in the future, this whole area
becomes an historical monument.

605
00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:37.870
You're standing
almost on the exact spot

606
00:57:37.955 --> 00:57:40.123
where your statue's gonna be.

607
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:42.542
- Statue?
- Oh, yeah!

608
00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:48.005
It's marble, about 20 meters tall,
and you're looking up at the sky,

609
00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:51.759
and your hand's sort of reaching
toward the future.

610
00:57:52.761 --> 00:57:54.554
I gotta take a leak.

611
00:57:56.431 --> 00:58:00.226
Leak? I'm not detecting any leak.

612
00:58:01.395 --> 00:58:04.438
Don't you people from the 24th century
ever pee?

613
00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:08.401
Leak! I get it.

614
00:58:09.903 --> 00:58:11.654
That's pretty funny.

615
00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:14.365
Excuse me.

616
00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:16.576
Commander?

617
00:58:24.293 --> 00:58:25.751
- Captain.
- Jean-Luc.

618
00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:29.547
Reports of my assimilation
are greatly exaggerated.

619
00:58:29.631 --> 00:58:31.841
I found something you lost.

620
00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:38.764
- I am a Klingon.
- Mr. Worf, report.

621
00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:42.643
The Borg control over half the ship.

622
00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:45.271
We have tried to restore power
to the Bridge and the weapon systems,

623
00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:48.566
- but we have been unsuccessful.
- We have another problem.

624
00:58:49.026 --> 00:58:50.943
I've accessed a Borg neuroprocessor,

625
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:52.570
and I've discovered
what they're trying to do.

626
00:58:52.654 --> 00:58:56.115
They're transforming the deflector dish
into an interplexing beacon.

627
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.200
Interplexing?

628
00:58:57.284 --> 00:59:00.870
It's a subspace transmitter.
If they activate the beacon,

629
00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:03.789
they'll be able to establish a link
with the Borg living in this century.

630
00:59:04.124 --> 00:59:07.251
But in the 21st century,
the Borg are still in the Delta Quadrant.

631
00:59:07.502 --> 00:59:11.214
They'll send reinforcements.
Humanity will be an easy target.

632
00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:14.050
Attack the Earth in the past
to assimilate the future.

633
00:59:14.134 --> 00:59:17.511
Then we must destroy the deflector dish
before they can activate the beacon.

634
00:59:17.596 --> 00:59:21.140
We can't get to deflector control
or a shuttlecraft...

635
00:59:24.102 --> 00:59:28.022
Mr. Worf, do you remember
your zero-g combat training?

636
00:59:28.482 --> 00:59:31.275
I remember
it made me sick to my stomach.

637
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:35.571
What are you suggesting?

638
00:59:35.656 --> 00:59:38.491
I think it's time that we took a little stroll.

639
00:59:43.997 --> 00:59:47.750
Hang on.
There's a humanoid life-sign up ahead.

640
00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.795
Five hundred eleven meters.

641
00:59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.304
Cochrane?

642
01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:04.725
It's him, all right.

643
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.948
I've re-modulated the pulse emitters,

644
01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.284
but I do not believe we will get
more than one or two shots

645
01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:25.121
- before the Borg adapt.
- Then we must make every shot count.

646
01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.293
Magnetize.

647
01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:38.426
- Watch your caboose, Dix.
- I intend to.

648
01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:03.534
- How are you doing, Mr. Worf?
- Not well, sir.

649
01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:08.122
Try not to look at the stars.
Keep your eyes on the hull.

650
01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:14.920
Let's go.

651
01:01:40.072 --> 01:01:43.616
Tell me, are you using
a polymer-based neuro-relay

652
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.534
to transmit the organic nerve impulses

653
01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:48.621
to the central processor
of my positronic net?

654
01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:50.956
If that is the case,

655
01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:53.667
how have you solved the problem
of increased signal degradation

656
01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:55.961
inherent to organo-synthetic
transmission...

657
01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:58.255
Do you always talk this much?

658
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.885
Not always, but often.

659
01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.515
Why do you insist on utilizing
this primitive linguistic communication?

660
01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:10.893
Your android brain is capable
of so much more.

661
01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:14.313
Have you forgotten? I am endeavoring
to become more human.

662
01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:19.110
Human. We used to be
exactly like them. Flawed, weak,

663
01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.528
organic.

664
01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.657
But we evolved to include the synthetic.

665
01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:27.701
Now we use both to attain perfection.

666
01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:31.038
Your goal should be the same as ours.

667
01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:39.046
Believing oneself to be perfect
is often the sign of a delusional mind.

668
01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:42.091
Small words from a small being

669
01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.260
trying to attack
what he doesn't understand.

670
01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:47.471
I understand that you have
no real interest in me,

671
01:02:47.556 --> 01:02:50.266
that your goal is
to obtain the encryption codes

672
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.435
for the Enterprise computer.

673
01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:55.521
That is one of our goals, one of many.

674
01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:01.152
But in order to reach it,
I am willing to help you reach yours.

675
01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.054
Is it becoming clear to you yet?

676
01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.724
Look at yourself,

677
01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:35.436
standing there, cradling the new flesh
that I've given you.

678
01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.482
If it means nothing to you,
why protect it?

679
01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:45.029
I am simply imitating
the behavior of humans.

680
01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:47.656
You're becoming more human
all the time, Data.

681
01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:50.075
Now you're learning how to lie.

682
01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:57.208
My programming was not designed
to process these sensations.

683
01:03:57.709 --> 01:04:01.587
Then tear the skin from your limb
as you would a defective circuit.

684
01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:07.718
Go ahead, Data. We won't stop you.

685
01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.936
Do it. Don't be tempted by flesh.

686
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:30.783
Are you familiar
with physical forms of pleasure?

687
01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:38.290
If you are referring to sexuality,

688
01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:43.212
I am fully functional,

689
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:48.634
programmed in multiple techniques.

690
01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:51.804
How long has it been
since you've used them?

691
01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:53.806
Eight years,

692
01:04:54.683 --> 01:04:57.601
seven months, 16 days,
four minutes, 22...

693
01:04:57.686 --> 01:04:59.144
Far too long.

694
01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.470
- We should bring reinforcements.
- There's no time.

695
01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:37.850
It looks as if they're building the beacon
right on top of the particle emitter.

696
01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.102
Once all the transponder rods
are in place,

697
01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:41.353
the beacon will be activated.

698
01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:43.689
Well, if we set our phasers
to full power, we can...

699
01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:47.067
No. There's a risk that we hit the dish.
It's charged with antiprotons.

700
01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:51.322
We could destroy half the ship.
We have to find another way.

701
01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.338
Come on, come on.

702
01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:13.052
- Doctor!
- Sir?

703
01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.434
You still looking for the bathroom?

704
01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:24.104
- I'm not going back.
- Look, Doc, we can't do this without you.

705
01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.732
I don't care. I don't wanna be a statue.

706
01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.567
- Doctor...
- You stay away from me.

707
01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:30.986
We don't have time for this.

708
01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:50.422
You told him about the statue?

709
01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:56.720
For this to work, all three maglocks
will have to be released.

710
01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.562
Magnetic constrictors are disengaged.

711
01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:14.066
They've adapted.

712
01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:15.502
Warning. Decompression in 45 seconds.

713
01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:42.529
Hawk!

714
01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.480
We've had a change of plans, Data.

715
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:33.950
Assimilate this.

716
01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:06.525
Only got an hour to go, Doc.
How you feeling?

717
01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:08.235
I got a four-alarm hangover,

718
01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:12.572
either from the whiskey
or your laser beam, or both,

719
01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:16.159
but I'm ready to make history.

720
01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:18.995
- Troi to Commander Riker.
- Riker here.

721
01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:22.541
- We're ready to open the launch door.
- Go ahead.

722
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.847
Look at that.

723
01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.144
What, you don't have a moon
in the 24th century?

724
01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:44.396
Sure we do. It just looks a lot different.

725
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.440
There are 50 million people
living on the moon in my time.

726
01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:52.237
You can see Tycho City, New Berlin,
even Lake Armstrong on a day like this.

727
01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:56.074
- And you know, Doctor...
- Please!

728
01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:58.827
Don't tell me it's all thanks to me.

729
01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:01.913
I've heard enough
about the great Zefram Cochrane.

730
01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:03.290
I don't know
who writes your history books

731
01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:05.125
or where you get your information from,

732
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:08.461
but you people got
some pretty funny ideas about me.

733
01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:14.467
You all look at me as if I'm some kind
of saint or visionary or something.

734
01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:18.346
I don't think you're a saint, Doc,
but you did have a vision.

735
01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:21.516
And now we're sitting in it.

736
01:15:22.476 --> 01:15:24.811
You wanna know what my vision is?

737
01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:27.230
Dollar signs. Money.

738
01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:32.068
I didn't build this ship
to usher in a new era for humanity.

739
01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:37.657
You think I want to go to the stars?
I don't even like to fly! I take trains!

740
01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:43.455
I built this ship so that I could retire
to some tropical island

741
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:48.001
filled with naked women.

742
01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:51.963
That's Zefram Cochrane.
That's his vision.

743
01:15:52.924 --> 01:15:56.760
This other guy you keep talking about,
this historical figure,

744
01:15:58.262 --> 01:15:59.846
I never met him.

745
01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.682
I can't imagine I ever will.

746
01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:08.563
Someone once said, "Don't try to be
a great man. Just be a man,

747
01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:11.399
"and let history
make its own judgments."

748
01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:13.568
That's rhetorical nonsense.

749
01:16:15.363 --> 01:16:18.949
- Who said that?
- You did, 10 years from now.

750
01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:23.828
You got 58 minutes, Doc.
You better get on that checklist.

751
01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:26.831
They're on the move again.

752
01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.500
The Borg just overran
three of our defense checkpoints.

753
01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:31.503
They've taken over Decks 5 and 6.

754
01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.380
They've adapted
to every modulation of our weapons.

755
01:16:33.464 --> 01:16:35.006
It's like we're shooting blanks.

756
01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:36.424
We'll have to work
on finding another way

757
01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:39.344
to modify our weapons
so they'll be more effective.

758
01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.681
In the meantime,
tell your men to stand their ground.

759
01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:45.392
- Sir...
- Fight hand-to-hand if they have to.

760
01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:48.436
Aye, sir.

761
01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:54.776
Wait.
Captain, our weapons are useless.

762
01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.861
We must activate
the auto-destruct sequence

763
01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.072
and use the escape pods
to evacuate the ship.

764
01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.198
No!

765
01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:03.535
Jean-Luc, if we destroy the ship,
we destroy the Borg.

766
01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:05.829
We're gonna stay and fight.

767
01:17:05.913 --> 01:17:08.873
Sir, we have lost the Enterprise.
We should not sacrifice...

768
01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.750
We have not lost
the Enterprise, Mr. Worf.

769
01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:12.460
We are not going to lose the Enterprise.

770
01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:14.754
Not to the Borg,
not while I'm in command.

771
01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:17.674
- You have your orders.
- I must object to this course of action.

772
01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:18.967
- It is...
- The objection is noted.

773
01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:20.802
With all due respect, sir,

774
01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:24.764
I believe you are allowing
your personal experience with the Borg

775
01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.975
to influence your judgment.

776
01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.145
You're afraid.

777
01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:33.940
You want to destroy the ship
and run away. You coward.

778
01:17:34.108 --> 01:17:35.400
Jean-Luc.

779
01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:41.072
If you were any other man,
I would kill you where you stand.

780
01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:43.199
Get off my Bridge.

781
01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:00.342
- So what do we do now?
- We carry out his orders.

782
01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:02.135
Dyson, Kaplan,

783
01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.219
- start working on a way to modify...
- Wait!

784
01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:04.512
...the weapon systems.
- This is stupid!

785
01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:07.515
If we can get off this ship
and then blow it up, let's do it!

786
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.934
Once the Captain's made up his mind,
the discussion is over.

787
01:18:10.478 --> 01:18:11.519
Lily!

788
01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.275
- You son of a bitch.
- This really isn't the time.

789
01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.695
Okay, I don't know jack
about the 24th century,

790
01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.781
but everybody out there thinks
that staying here

791
01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:24.366
and fighting the Borg is suicide.

792
01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:26.242
They're just afraid to come in here
and say it.

793
01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:28.703
The crew is accustomed
to following my orders.

794
01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:31.122
They're probably accustomed
to your orders making sense.

795
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:34.042
None of them
understand the Borg as I do.

796
01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:37.170
No one does.

797
01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:39.506
No one can.

798
01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.466
What is that supposed to mean?

799
01:18:46.514 --> 01:18:50.934
Six years ago,
they assimilated me into their collective.

800
01:18:53.104 --> 01:18:56.815
I had their cybernetic devices
implanted throughout my body.

801
01:18:57.358 --> 01:19:01.986
I was linked to the hive mind,
every trace of individuality erased.

802
01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.407
I was one of them.

803
01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.159
So you can imagine, my dear,

804
01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:10.537
I have a somewhat unique perspective
on the Borg,

805
01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:12.747
and I know how to fight them.

806
01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:14.999
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have work to do.

807
01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:18.837
I am such an idiot.

808
01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:23.967
It's so simple.

809
01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:28.054
The Borg hurt you,
and now you're going to hurt them back.

810
01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.182
In my century,
we don't succumb to revenge.

811
01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.351
We have a more evolved sensibility.

812
01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:35.520
Bullshit! I saw the look on your face

813
01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.189
when you shot those Borg
on the Holodeck.

814
01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:40.400
You were almost enjoying it!

815
01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.530
- How dare you.
- Oh, come on, Captain.

816
01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:48.783
You're not the first man
to get a thrill from murdering someone.

817
01:19:48.868 --> 01:19:50.535
I see it all the time!

818
01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.162
- Get out!
- Or what?

819
01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:55.832
You'll kill me
like you killed Ensign Lynch?

820
01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.710
- There was no way to save him.
- You didn't even try.

821
01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:01.212
Where was
your evolved sensibility then?

822
01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:03.548
- I don't have time for this.
- Hey.

823
01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:07.260
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt your little quest.

824
01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:09.971
Captain Ahab has to go hunt his whale.

825
01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:13.725
What?

826
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:16.853
You do have books in the 24th century?

827
01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:19.981
- This is not about revenge.
- Liar!

828
01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.066
This is about saving
the future of humanity!

829
01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:24.903
- Jean-Luc, blow up the damn ship!
- No!

830
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.572
No!

831
01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:43.087
I will not sacrifice the Enterprise.

832
01:20:44.215 --> 01:20:47.926
We've made too many compromises
already, too many retreats.

833
01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:52.138
They invade our space and we fall back.

834
01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:56.726
They assimilate entire worlds
and we fall back.

835
01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:58.853
Not again.

836
01:20:58.938 --> 01:21:02.774
The line must be drawn here.
This far, no further!

837
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:09.697
And I will make them pay
for what they've done.

838
01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:37.058
You broke your little ships.

839
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.154
See you around, Ahab.

840
01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:56.494
"And he piled upon
the whale's white hump

841
01:21:57.329 --> 01:22:01.165
"the sum of all the rage and hate
felt by his whole race.

842
01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:07.672
"If his chest had been a cannon,
he would have shot his heart upon it."

843
01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:09.507
What?

844
01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.012
Moby-Dick.

845
01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:17.682
Actually, I never read it.

846
01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:28.443
Ahab spent years hunting
the white whale that crippled him,

847
01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:31.529
a quest for vengeance,

848
01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:38.286
but in the end,
it destroyed him and his ship.

849
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.042
I guess he didn't know when to quit.

850
01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:10.693
Prepare to evacuate the Enterprise.

851
01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:36.761
- ATR setting?
- Active.

852
01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:39.931
- Main bus?
- Ready.

853
01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.266
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.

854
01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:47.522
Begin auto-destruct sequence.
Authorization, Picard 4-7-alpha-tango.

855
01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:49.732
Computer,
Commander Beverly Crusher.

856
01:23:49.817 --> 01:23:54.070
Confirm auto-destruct sequence.
Authorization, Crusher 2-2-beta-charlie.

857
01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:56.698
Computer,
Lieutenant Commander Worf.

858
01:23:56.782 --> 01:24:01.077
Confirm auto-destruct sequence.
Authorization, Worf 3-7-gamma-echo.

859
01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:03.371
Command authorization accepted.

860
01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:06.457
Awaiting final code
to begin auto-destruct sequence.

861
01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:08.251
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

862
01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:12.130
Destruct sequence alpha-one.
Fifteen minutes, silent countdown.

863
01:24:16.009 --> 01:24:17.218
Enable.

864
01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.014
Self-destruct in 15 minutes.
There will be no further audio warnings.

865
01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.769
So much for the Enterprise-E.

866
01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:28.980
We barely knew her.

867
01:24:29.148 --> 01:24:31.441
Think they'll build another one?

868
01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:33.943
Plenty of letters left in the alphabet.

869
01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:37.822
Mr. Worf.

870
01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:47.165
I regret some of the things
I said to you earlier.

871
01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:48.541
Some?

872
01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:51.335
As a matter of fact,

873
01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:55.006
I think you're the bravest man
I've ever known.

874
01:24:56.675 --> 01:24:58.176
Thank you, sir.

875
01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:02.388
See you on Gravett Island.

876
01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:28.915
Captain.

877
01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:35.922
Data?

878
01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:40.468
Control to Phoenix. Final
launch sequence checks are complete.

879
01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:41.803
Good luck.

880
01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:44.722
- Everybody ready to make some history?
- Always am.

881
01:25:44.807 --> 01:25:47.058
- I think I forgot something.
- What?

882
01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:50.102
I don't know. It's probably nothing.

883
01:25:51.104 --> 01:25:52.939
Begin ignition sequence.

884
01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:00.154
- 20, 19...
- Oh, God!

885
01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:01.823
- Now I remember!
- What?

886
01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:03.658
- Where is it?
- What?

887
01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:06.369
- We can't lift off without it!
- Geordi, we've got to abort.

888
01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:08.287
No! No, wait, I found it.

889
01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:11.332
...12, 11, 10,

890
01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:13.584
9, 8...

891
01:26:13.961 --> 01:26:16.170
- Let's rock and roll!
...7, 6...

892
01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:49.787
Turn that down a little?

893
01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:54.709
Hey! We've got a red light
on the second intake valve.

894
01:27:00.299 --> 01:27:02.633
Ignore it. We'll be fine.

895
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:06.971
Prepare first stage shutdown
and separation on my mark.

896
01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:11.559
3, 2, 1,

897
01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:12.643
mark!

898
01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.703
Okay, let's bring the warp core online.

899
01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:41.339
You ain't seen nothing yet.

900
01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:45.426
If you see Commander Riker
or any of my crew, give them this.

901
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:47.094
What is it?

902
01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:49.597
Orders to find a quiet corner
of North America

903
01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.016
and stay out of history's way.

904
01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:54.810
Well, good luck.

905
01:27:55.354 --> 01:27:56.854
To both of us.

906
01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:03.027
You're not leaving, are you?

907
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:07.615
Lily, when I was held captive
on the Borg ship,

908
01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:09.617
my crew risked everything to save me.

909
01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:11.035
There is

910
01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:13.079
someone

911
01:28:13.163 --> 01:28:14.372
still on this ship,

912
01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.749
and I owe him the same.

913
01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:23.547
Go and find your friend.

914
01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:58.768
What's wrong, Locutus?
Isn't this familiar?

915
01:29:59.478 --> 01:30:02.313
Organic minds are such fragile things.

916
01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:06.484
How could you forget me so quickly?

917
01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:08.986
We were very close, you and I.

918
01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:12.656
You can still hear our song.

919
01:30:14.659 --> 01:30:15.910
Yes, I...

920
01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:19.038
I remember you.

921
01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:21.791
You were there all the time.

922
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.127
But that ship

923
01:30:27.589 --> 01:30:29.840
and all the Borg on it were destroyed.

924
01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:33.469
You think
in such three-dimensional terms.

925
01:30:33.553 --> 01:30:35.554
How small you've become.

926
01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:37.973
Data understands me.

927
01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:41.310
Don't you, Data?

928
01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:47.108
What have you done to him?

929
01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:49.693
Given him what he always wanted,
flesh and blood.

930
01:30:52.572 --> 01:30:56.075
Let him go. He's not the one you want.

931
01:30:57.077 --> 01:30:59.245
Are you offering yourself to us?

932
01:31:00.997 --> 01:31:02.581
Offering myself?

933
01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:08.671
That's it. I remember now.

934
01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:11.674
It wasn't enough that you assimilate me.

935
01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:15.928
I had to give myself freely to the Borg.

936
01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:20.474
- To you.
- You flatter yourself.

937
01:31:20.559 --> 01:31:22.560
I've overseen the assimilation
of countless millions.

938
01:31:22.644 --> 01:31:25.104
- You were no different.
- You're lying.

939
01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:28.274
You wanted more
than just another Borg drone.

940
01:31:28.358 --> 01:31:30.985
You wanted a human being
with a mind of his own

941
01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:33.487
who could bridge the gulf
between humanity and the Borg.

942
01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.322
You wanted a counterpart.

943
01:31:35.574 --> 01:31:37.366
But I resisted.

944
01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:38.868
I fought you.

945
01:31:39.369 --> 01:31:42.621
You can't begin to imagine
the life you denied yourself.

946
01:31:47.586 --> 01:31:49.253
It's not too late.

947
01:31:52.465 --> 01:31:56.385
Locutus could still be with you,
just in the way you wanted,

948
01:31:57.721 --> 01:31:59.096
an equal.

949
01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:04.101
Let Data go,
and I will take my place at your side,

950
01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:07.605
willingly, without any resistance.

951
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.441
Such a noble creature,

952
01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:14.111
a quality we sometimes lack.

953
01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:18.908
We will add your distinctiveness
to our own.

954
01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:24.788
Welcome home, Locutus.

955
01:32:30.212 --> 01:32:31.754
Data, you are free to go.

956
01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:36.800
- Data, go.
- No.

957
01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:41.472
I do not wish to go.

958
01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:44.975
As you can see,
I have already found an equal.

959
01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:49.813
Data, deactivate
the self-destruct sequence.

960
01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:53.609
Data, no. Don't do it.

961
01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.571
Data, listen to me.

962
01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:01.617
Auto-destruct sequence deactivated.

963
01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:08.832
Now enter the encryption codes
and give me computer control.

964
01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:11.502
Data!

965
01:33:15.048 --> 01:33:16.173
Data.

966
01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:29.103
He will make an excellent drone.

967
01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:41.699
Plasma injectors are online.
Everything's looking good.

968
01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:43.951
I think we're ready.

969
01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:45.869
They should be out there right now.

970
01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:48.247
We better break the warp barrier
in the next five minutes

971
01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:49.456
if we're gonna get their attention.

972
01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:52.584
- Nacelles are charged and ready.
- Let's do it!

973
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:54.920
Engage!

974
01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:07.349
Warp field is looking good.

975
01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:10.686
Structural integrity is holding.

976
01:34:11.396 --> 01:34:13.981
- Speed?
- 20,000 kilometers per second.

977
01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:20.904
Sweet Jesus!

978
01:34:25.076 --> 01:34:27.911
Relax, Doctor. I'm sure they're just here
to give us a send-off.

979
01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:35.169
I am bringing
the external sensors online.

980
01:34:42.594 --> 01:34:45.054
Thirty seconds to warp threshold.

981
01:34:56.232 --> 01:34:58.192
Approaching light-speed.

982
01:34:58.276 --> 01:35:00.277
We're at critical velocity.

983
01:35:00.779 --> 01:35:03.530
- Quantum torpedoes locked.
- Destroy them.

984
01:35:11.831 --> 01:35:14.833
Watch your future's end.

985
01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.644
Data!

986
01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:36.939
Resistance is futile.

987
01:37:03.902 --> 01:37:07.571
That should be enough.
Throttle back. Take us out of warp.

988
01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:20.918
Is that Earth?

989
01:37:21.586 --> 01:37:22.920
That's it.

990
01:37:24.506 --> 01:37:26.006
It's so small.

991
01:37:26.925 --> 01:37:29.134
It's about to get a whole lot bigger.

992
01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:52.759
Captain.

993
01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:54.344
Data.

994
01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:57.806
Are you all right?

995
01:38:58.224 --> 01:39:00.183
I would imagine I look worse than I

996
01:39:03.896 --> 01:39:05.147
feel.

997
01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:12.195
Strange.

998
01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:17.701
Part of me is sorry she is dead.

999
01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:23.290
She was unique.

1000
01:39:23.708 --> 01:39:27.586
She brought me closer to humanity
than I ever thought possible,

1001
01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:30.589
and for a time,

1002
01:39:31.674 --> 01:39:33.508
I was tempted by her offer.

1003
01:39:35.845 --> 01:39:37.429
How long a time?

1004
01:39:40.141 --> 01:39:42.059
Zero-point-six-eight seconds, sir.

1005
01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:49.191
For an android, that is nearly an eternity.

1006
01:40:01.412 --> 01:40:05.582
Captain's Log, April 5th, 2063.

1007
01:40:06.459 --> 01:40:08.502
The voyage of the Phoenix
was a success,

1008
01:40:09.337 --> 01:40:10.545
again.

1009
01:40:11.005 --> 01:40:13.965
The alien ship detected
the warp signature

1010
01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:16.968
and is on its way
to rendezvous with history.

1011
01:41:30.752 --> 01:41:32.002
My God.

1012
01:41:33.087 --> 01:41:34.880
They're really from another world.

1013
01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:38.467
And they're going to want to meet
the man who flew that warp ship.

1014
01:42:30.102 --> 01:42:31.978
Live long and prosper.

1015
01:42:53.584 --> 01:42:55.168
Thanks.

1016
01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:02.425
I think it's time we made a discreet exit.

1017
01:43:04.053 --> 01:43:06.680
Riker to Enterprise,
stand by to beam us up.

1018
01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.939
You gotta go?

1019
01:43:20.278 --> 01:43:21.778
I envy you,

1020
01:43:22.613 --> 01:43:24.656
the world you're going to.

1021
01:43:26.617 --> 01:43:28.118
I envy you,

1022
01:43:29.078 --> 01:43:31.997
taking these first steps
into a new frontier.

1023
01:43:34.584 --> 01:43:36.459
I shall miss you, Lily.

1024
01:43:51.767 --> 01:43:54.144
Picard to Enterprise. Energize.

1025
01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:04.821
- Report.
- The moon's gravitational field

1026
01:44:04.906 --> 01:44:07.741
obscured our warp signature.
The Vulcans did not detect us.

1027
01:44:07.825 --> 01:44:09.534
Captain, I've reconfigured our warp field

1028
01:44:09.619 --> 01:44:11.411
to match the chronometric readings
of the Borg sphere.

1029
01:44:11.495 --> 01:44:13.413
- Recreate the vortex, Commander.
- Aye, sir.

1030
01:44:13.497 --> 01:44:15.040
All decks report ready.

1031
01:44:15.249 --> 01:44:17.083
- Helm standing by.
- Mr. Data,

1032
01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:19.753
lay in a course for the 24th century.

1033
01:44:19.837 --> 01:44:22.631
I suspect our future is there
waiting for us.

1034
01:44:23.132 --> 01:44:24.883
Course laid in, sir.

1035
01:44:27.345 --> 01:44:28.678
Make it so.
